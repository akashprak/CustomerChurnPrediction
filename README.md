# Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. It is part of the **LLOYDS Data Science Certificate** program.

## Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses to identify customers who are likely to stop using their services. By leveraging machine learning, this project aims to provide actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

## Objectives

- Analyze customer data to identify patterns and trends.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict churn.
- Provide recommendations to minimize customer churn.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains customer information, including demographics, account details, and usage patterns. It has been preprocessed to ensure data quality and consistency.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Exploration**: Understand the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
3. **Model Development**: Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Compare models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Insights and Recommendations**: Summarize findings and provide actionable insights.

## Results

The project successfully identified key factors contributing to customer churn and achieved high prediction accuracy using the selected machine learning model.
